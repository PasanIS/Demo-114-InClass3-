      <h2>Introduction to Wonders in the World</h2>
      <p>
        The New 7 Wonders of the World is a contemporary list of seven
        exceptional structures selected through a global poll orchestrated by
        the New7Wonders Foundation. This initiative was initiated by Swiss-born
        Canadian filmmaker and author Bernard Weber in the year 2000, with the
        objective of recognizing and celebrating human ingenuity, cultural
        heritage, and architectural marvels. The campaign invited people from
        all over the world to participate in voting for their favorite sites,
        emphasizing the universal appeal and significance of these extraordinary
        places.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chosen from among hundreds of initially proposed candidates, these seven
        wonders were selected through a global campaign and in 2007, they won
        initial tallies of over 100 million votes. From ancient structures of
        over 2000 years to more modern and recognized masterpieces, the seven
        wonders were chosen based on a global range of countries, continents,
        and historical periods, reflecting diverse cultural backgrounds and
        architectural brilliance. These include the Great Wall of China, Petra
        in Jordan, Christ the Redeemer in Brazil, Machu Picchu in Peru, Chichen
        Itza in Mexico, the Roman Colosseum in Italy, and the Taj Mahal in
        India. Each site stands as a testament to human creativity, resilience,
        and the ability to create enduring legacies that continue to inspire and
        awe millions of visitors worldwide.

      <h2>The Seven Wonders</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>1. Great Wall of China (China)</summary>
        <div class="details-content">
          <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Great Wall of China, an ancient defensive architecture,
            stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China. Originally
            conceived by Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BCE, its
            construction spanned several dynasties, notably the Ming Dynasty.
            The wall was built to protect against invasions from nomadic tribes
            and features walls, watchtowers, and fortresses. It stands as a
            testament to Chinese engineering and military strategy, symbolizing
            strength and perseverance.

        <summary>2. Petra (Jordan)</summary>
        <div class="details-content">
          <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
          <p>
            Petra, an archaeological city in southern Jordan, was the capital of
            the Nabataean Kingdom in the 4th century BCE. Carved into vibrant
            red, white, and pink sandstone cliffs, Petra is renowned for its
            rock-cut architecture and water conduit system. The city's most
            iconic structure is Al-Khazneh (The Treasury), a stunning temple
            with a grand Hellenistic facade. Petra was a significant trading
            hub, connecting the silk and spice routes of Asia with the
            Mediterranean. Its abandonment and rediscovery in the early 19th
            century by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt reignited global
            interest in its historical and architectural significance.

        <summary>3. Christ the Redeemer (Brazil)</summary>
        <div class="details-content">
          <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Christ the Redeemer statue stands atop the Corcovado Mountain in
            Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Completed in 1931, this 98-foot-tall statue
            of Jesus Christ, with its outstretched arms spanning 92 feet,
            overlooks the city. Designed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva
            Costa and French sculptor Paul Landowski, the statue is made of
            reinforced concrete and soapstone. It is a symbol of Christianity
            and a cultural icon of Brazil, representing peace and welcoming
            visitors with open arms.

        <div class="details-content">
          <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
          <p>
            Machu Picchu, an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in
            Peru, was built in the 15th century under the reign of Emperor
            Pachacuti. Rediscovered by American historian Hiram Bingham in 1911,
            this UNESCO World Heritage site features sophisticated dry-stone
            construction, terraced fields, and a network of fountains. Machu
            Picchu's purpose remains a mystery, speculated to be a royal estate
            or a religious site. It showcases the Incas' advanced engineering
            skills and deep understanding of their environment.

        <div class="details-content">
          <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
          <p>
            Chichen Itza, a large pre-Columbian archaeological site on Mexico's
            Yucatan Peninsula, was a major city of the Maya civilization.
            Flourishing from the 7th to 10th centuries, it features iconic
            structures like the pyramid of El Castillo (Temple of Kukulcan),
            which demonstrates the Maya's astronomical and architectural
            prowess. The site's numerous temples, palaces, and ball courts
            reveal a complex society with advanced knowledge in mathematics,
            astronomy, and acoustics.

        <div class="details-content">
          <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is a
            monumental symbol of ancient Rome. Completed in 80 AD, it could hold
            up to 80,000 spectators. This massive arena hosted gladiatorial
            contests, public spectacles, and theatrical performances. The
            Colosseum exemplifies Roman engineering ingenuity, with its
            sophisticated system of vaults, arches, and hypogeum. Despite
            centuries of damage from earthquakes and stone robbers, it remains a
            powerful icon of the enduring legacy of the Roman Empire.

          <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, is an exquisite white marble
            mausoleum built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife
            Mumtaz Mahal. Completed in 1653, this UNESCO World Heritage site is
            an epitome of Mughal architecture, blending elements of Islamic,
            Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian architectural styles. Its
            symmetrical design, intricate inlay work with semi-precious stones,
            and serene gardens make it a masterpiece of architectural beauty and
            a symbol of eternal love.
