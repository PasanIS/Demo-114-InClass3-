        <h2>Introduction to Wonders in the World</h2>
        <p>
          The New 7 Wonders of the World is a contemporary list of seven
          exceptional structures selected through a global poll orchestrated by
          the New7Wonders Foundation. This initiative was initiated by Swiss-born
          Canadian filmmaker and author Bernard Weber in the year 2000, with the
          objective of recognizing and celebrating human ingenuity, cultural
          heritage, and architectural marvels. The campaign invited people from
          all over the world to participate in voting for their favorite sites,
          emphasizing the universal appeal and significance of these extraordinary
          places.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chosen from among hundreds of initially proposed candidates, these seven
          wonders were selected through a global campaign and in 2007, they won
          initial tallies of over 100 million votes. From ancient structures of
          over 2000 years to more modern and recognized masterpieces, the seven
          wonders were chosen based on a global range of countries, continents,
          and historical periods, reflecting diverse cultural backgrounds and
          architectural brilliance. These include the Great Wall of China, Petra
          in Jordan, Christ the Redeemer in Brazil, Machu Picchu in Peru, Chichen
          Itza in Mexico, the Roman Colosseum in Italy, and the Taj Mahal in
          India. Each site stands as a testament to human creativity, resilience,
          and the ability to create enduring legacies that continue to inspire and
          awe millions of visitors worldwide.

            <p>
              The Great Wall of China, an ancient defensive architecture,
              stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China. Originally
              conceived by Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BCE, its
              construction spanned several dynasties, notably the Ming Dynasty.
              The wall was built to protect against invasions from nomadic tribes
              and features walls, watchtowers, and fortresses. It stands as a
              testament to Chinese engineering and military strategy, symbolizing
              strength and perseverance.

            <p>
              Petra, an archaeological city in southern Jordan, was the capital of
              the Nabataean Kingdom in the 4th century BCE. Carved into vibrant
              red, white, and pink sandstone cliffs, Petra is renowned for its
              rock-cut architecture and water conduit system. The city's most
              iconic structure is Al-Khazneh (The Treasury), a stunning temple
              with a grand Hellenistic facade. Petra was a significant trading
              hub, connecting the silk and spice routes of Asia with the
              Mediterranean. Its abandonment and rediscovery in the early 19th
              century by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt reignited global
              interest in its historical and architectural significance.

            <p>
              The Christ the Redeemer statue stands atop the Corcovado Mountain in
              Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Completed in 1931, this 98-foot-tall statue
              of Jesus Christ, with its outstretched arms spanning 92 feet,
              overlooks the city. Designed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva
              Costa and French sculptor Paul Landowski, the statue is made of
              reinforced concrete and soapstone. It is a symbol of Christianity
              and a cultural icon of Brazil, representing peace and welcoming
              visitors with open arms.

            <p>
              Machu Picchu, an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in
              Peru, was built in the 15th century under the reign of Emperor
              Pachacuti. Rediscovered by American historian Hiram Bingham in 1911,
              this UNESCO World Heritage site features sophisticated dry-stone
              construction, terraced fields, and a network of fountains. Machu
              Picchu's purpose remains a mystery, speculated to be a royal estate
              or a religious site. It showcases the Incas' advanced engineering
              skills and deep understanding of their environment.

            <p>
              Chichen Itza, a large pre-Columbian archaeological site on Mexico's
              Yucatan Peninsula, was a major city of the Maya civilization.
              Flourishing from the 7th to 10th centuries, it features iconic
              structures like the pyramid of El Castillo (Temple of Kukulcan),
              which demonstrates the Maya's astronomical and architectural
              prowess. The site's numerous temples, palaces, and ball courts
              reveal a complex society with advanced knowledge in mathematics,
              astronomy, and acoustics.

            <p>
              The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is a
              monumental symbol of ancient Rome. Completed in 80 AD, it could hold
              up to 80,000 spectators. This massive arena hosted gladiatorial
              contests, public spectacles, and theatrical performances. The
              Colosseum exemplifies Roman engineering ingenuity, with its
              sophisticated system of vaults, arches, and hypogeum. Despite
              centuries of damage from earthquakes and stone robbers, it remains a
              powerful icon of the enduring legacy of the Roman Empire.

              an epitome of Mughal architecture, blending elements of Islamic,
              Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian architectural styles. Its
